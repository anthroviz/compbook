I took two years at Gallatin and two years off from Gallatin for personal reasons. In the time that I wasn't a student, I learned a lot about the didactic methods I require and was perhaps overlooking in my excitement of becoming "a college student." I also learned about myself. I am excited to take these lessons back to Gallatin and formal education.

I chose Gallatin because I wanted more intellectual freedom than other schools that would have circumscribed me to the person I was when I was 18.

two- to three-page essay in which they reflect on their educational experiences and articulate their academic concentrations. the central idea(s) of their concentration and the relevant coursework. This essay is a way for students to reflect on how they learn as individuals and to develop an academic plan with long-term goals in mind. 

In writing the essay, students may want to begin by reflecting on their educational journey and exploring some of the following questions:

- Why did you choose Gallatin? What were your educational goals? Have those goals changed? Why and how?
- What educational experiences and courses (internships, seminars, independent studies, workshops, private lessons) have been influential to you? What was particularly interesting and why? What ideas have evolved from your educational experience so far?

Using these questions as a starting point, students can then turn their attention to the plan for their concentration:

- What idea, period, subject, theme, concept, discipline is of particular interest to you? Is there a central idea or theme around which your concentration may be organized?
- What kinds of study will you pursue? What types of courses (internships, seminars, independent studies, workshops, private lessons) will you take to construct the concentration and in what sequence might these classes be taken?
- What is the meaning of such a course of study? What connections does this course of study have to other work and educational experiences, and what is its relevance to your future plans for graduate study or career?

For most students, these questions are similar to those they answer when they complete the Gallatin Plan of Study form. The Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration becomes the opportunity to integrate these ideas and to help students to seek out the ways that their courses converge and coalesce into a unique, individualized course of study.
