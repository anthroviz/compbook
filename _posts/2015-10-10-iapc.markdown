SYSTEM

designers want to make things better - subjective experience of things

helping people connect ideas by different visualizations

inspiring how can thing be different or better

expression interactivity

helping people understand things enlightening people systems connecting things

different ways people learn and think, expression, communication, ideas

how to shift people's thinking to be more systematic long range and interdisciplinary

my perspective differs from many because i understand the world is not limitless. but i retain optimisim about making things better. my talents are in unpacking systems and making new ones to be better. 

participatory visual experiences for others to see potential

different ways of putting things together

telling stories honestly and helping others

making has always been important to me

i have learned a lot about myself in the past two years. i was living my life without really looking or noticing where i was going. now i spend my time in the moment, seeing what is in order to think about how things can be. of the moment, ideas are not always presented in the right ways.

the ego as a buffer is one of those things i've examined more closely.

knowing alternatives and ways of processes for future use

knowing how to do things

knowing that we can fix anything

unpacking systems that we live in and making new systems

systems provide flexibility

there is not one way of being

organic structures and the way they self-organize and maintain homeostasis

would like to get to there

symbiosis and win win

dynamic instead of static

being satisfied with what you have and always trying to make it better

### what will i study

making applied work outside of school

showing and collaborating with the entire gallatin ecosystem

helping grow and amplify each other

data point to make humanity's story more clear

fine lines between things. things are not that easy. things do not happen in a vaccuum.


--- ABOVE THIS LINE IS IA AND IT IS GREAT - NEEDS TO BE CUT DOWN ---

1. My experience with real life means a more realistic view of other peoples' stories
	- death
	- job
	- shit going down
2. understanding other people is the key to accomplishing on a personal scale and on a macro scale of improving the world
3. i believe i can help people understand each other through visual narratives

---

1. I want to study Visualizing Human Narratives, primarily a blend of Art, Design, Technology, Biology
2. In the end this is probably Anthropology
3. Exploring through visual representation, crafted and coded
4. Using that which makes us human (tools and art) to remind ourselves of our humanity - vulnerability, transparency
5. design has a huge influence on our every day - two are primarily future looking and two are primarily past looking

---

1. Also concerned with futurist notions of utopia and dystopia. Convinced that we need to be thinking about these more rigidly. In intellectual history many thinkers have tried to come up with origins in order to talk about future possibilities
2. tech has a huge opportunity here

---

- why these 4 main subjects?
- think they are analogous - just with more or less human involvement
- help people see the way things are
- realistic expectations
- unbounded possibilities
- training through art
- to see
- to render
- training through design
- to research
- to make better
- a lot of important issues in the world
- social justice
- needs to be explained in a way that people can understand
- data is important as a backbone
- visual style is important to be compelling
- sex appeal
- spreading knowledge and helping things be better
- believe in progress
- writing exercises
- five whys 1
- my concentration is in visualizing human narratives
- i am interested in telling stories through data
- i want people to understand deeper truths
- i can see those truths as well as ways that other people need to see them to understand them
- people don't really like to think or exert themselves
- people have other things to worry about on the most part, so here is making the longer term more legible

Nowadays, I'm much more interested in myself as a tool in making these systems better than myself as a particular winner within the system. In working as a professional designer in a large company, I've realized that design and technology have powerful influence over our everyday experience.

I want to combine my skills in building and making, my talent of seeing the bigger picture, and love of helping others.

My concentration will be entitled Visualizing Human Narratives. I will be looking at data and storytelling through the lenses and disciplines of art, design, technology, and biology. How do we make sense of the world? What are the stories we tell ourselves?

To finish up my degree, I will pursue classes which interest me and which explore the human condition.

I've shifted from being inwardly focused, like a microscope, to being generative. 

I am inspired by win-win situations. I am interested in building tools and systems. I am interested in analyzing humanity's origins (which many would argue is precipitated by tools and art) and directing where we can go in the future.

Working in the tech industry and leading the NYC collegiate tech community has taught me about the problematic culture in tech at the moment. In fact, the swagger feels like me, as a Freshman. And yet there is so much potential. I think we can change the thinking without similar catastrophes occurring. The tech industry is correct in assuming it will shape the future. I want to challenge some of the problematic foundations, so we don't build a future disaster.

We forget in all the buzzword talk about "big data" and "artificial intelligence" that technology (in the narrow sense) is just another [[cool branch]] of technology as tools. I mean this in the sense that tools are built to support humanity, to help us realize our great imaginative potential. We forget that big data is comprised of many small datapoints of individual human stories.

I want to both explore these human stories for their own sake as interesting data, as well as leverage my work as a cultural critique.

Visual representation is a powerful and immediate way to communicate - it marks the advent of humanity. Code and design are ways to amplify the messages of art through democratization. Analogies and systems.

### notes


[Stories data to bear it out. Bringing the magic of fiction into everyday life... humanizing... Tech and Design are humanmade ways to channel art and science]

[What has consistently interested me and what I've only realized now is... I've realized recently that...]

[...]

I no longer feel threatened by that which I don't know, nor jealous of what others have. I now like to challenge myself and build up skills and knowledge, while supporting others in doing so.


All these lessons learned through drawing and painting praxis are applicable here.

Meta communities // Onions // Layers // Contexts // figurative-representative is about seeing clearly, I used to do portraiture a lot. Seeing things for what things are. Improvising and riffing means training. Seeing what could be, based on an intuitive learned knowledge of what is

Become someone who makes things happen instead of waiting around and stewing - understanding that other people also yearn and feel awkward. Now that I've obtained some power, I want to use that for good and help other people up.

Intentional communities

She loves fostering inclusive communities and connecting worthy people, especially in the tech industry. Others have used the following analogies to describe her: a radar, an interpersonal basket-weaver, a Swiss Army Knife, and a simulated stimulant.

Connecting the dots - people, ideas

there are so many ways to represent information and narratives that our usual approaches don't do justice. we're taught in primary school to write double spaced 12pt times new roman pieces, in preparation of our workforce assimilation. this flattening kills the spirit and essence - the unique personality of what you're trying to express, turned into a standardized format which is easy for an overworked teacher to parse and give you your âˆš+.

getting to college is a huge shift. you realize that your teachers are no longer mostly undifferentiated. sure, one math teacher may be more strict than another - but your professors are influential people in and of the world.

form follows function, but form is also of function.

my coursework will follow professors. i would like to do many gallatin seminars. maybe i could do independent studies or tutorials with particular interests.

### Goals

two- to three-page essay in which they reflect on their educational experiences and articulate their academic concentrations. the central idea(s) of their concentration and the relevant coursework. This essay is a way for students to reflect on how they learn as individuals and to develop an academic plan with long-term goals in mind. 

In writing the essay, students may want to begin by reflecting on their educational journey and exploring some of the following questions:

- Why did you choose Gallatin? What were your educational goals? Have those goals changed? Why and how?
- What educational experiences and courses (internships, seminars, independent studies, workshops, private lessons) have been influential to you? What was particularly interesting and why? What ideas have evolved from your educational experience so far?

Using these questions as a starting point, students can then turn their attention to the plan for their concentration:

- What idea, period, subject, theme, concept, discipline is of particular interest to you? Is there a central idea or theme around which your concentration may be organized?
- What kinds of study will you pursue? What types of courses (internships, seminars, independent studies, workshops, private lessons) will you take to construct the concentration and in what sequence might these classes be taken?
- What is the meaning of such a course of study? What connections does this course of study have to other work and educational experiences, and what is its relevance to your future plans for graduate study or career?

For most students, these questions are similar to those they answer when they complete the Gallatin Plan of Study form. The Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration becomes the opportunity to integrate these ideas and to help students to seek out the ways that their courses converge and coalesce into a unique, individualized course of study.
