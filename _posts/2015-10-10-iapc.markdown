I took two years at Gallatin and two years off from Gallatin for personal reasons. In the time that I wasn't a student, I learned a lot about the didactic methods I require and was perhaps overlooking in my excitement of becoming "a college student." I also learned about myself. I am excited to take these lessons back to Gallatin and formal education.

I chose Gallatin because I wanted more intellectual freedom than other schools that would have circumscribed me to the person I was when I was 18. I also knew I belonged in New York.

I came into Gallatin after a huge trauma and a huge ego to match, as a buffer. My thinking back then was self-centered: that the Self is the most important determining factor, that we all have the will to power. I have since learned that this is ridiculous. I think we are comprised of systems and I'm much more interested in myself as a tool in making these systems better than myself as a winner within the system. In that sense, I came in with grandiose thoughts about being a great artist or entrepreneur, but with a myopic focus on the end result rather than enjoying or even noticing the process. 

It's this shift from becoming a

I was Icarus; I flew too close to the sun.

I thought then that having a fantastic life would offset the horrors that I had experienced. That somehow, since I had gone to the nadir, it would oscillate to a zenith. This is faulty thinking.

My concetration will be entitled Visualizing Human Narratives. I will be looking at data and storytelling through the lenses and disciplines of art, design, technology, and biology.

I will pursue classes which interest me and which explore the human condition. I will be working fulltime at my corporate job whilst finishing my undergraduate degree.

I am interested in this story because of [[[[[[[big data small data]]]]]]

two- to three-page essay in which they reflect on their educational experiences and articulate their academic concentrations. the central idea(s) of their concentration and the relevant coursework. This essay is a way for students to reflect on how they learn as individuals and to develop an academic plan with long-term goals in mind. 

In writing the essay, students may want to begin by reflecting on their educational journey and exploring some of the following questions:

- Why did you choose Gallatin? What were your educational goals? Have those goals changed? Why and how?
- What educational experiences and courses (internships, seminars, independent studies, workshops, private lessons) have been influential to you? What was particularly interesting and why? What ideas have evolved from your educational experience so far?

Using these questions as a starting point, students can then turn their attention to the plan for their concentration:

- What idea, period, subject, theme, concept, discipline is of particular interest to you? Is there a central idea or theme around which your concentration may be organized?
- What kinds of study will you pursue? What types of courses (internships, seminars, independent studies, workshops, private lessons) will you take to construct the concentration and in what sequence might these classes be taken?
- What is the meaning of such a course of study? What connections does this course of study have to other work and educational experiences, and what is its relevance to your future plans for graduate study or career?

For most students, these questions are similar to those they answer when they complete the Gallatin Plan of Study form. The Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration becomes the opportunity to integrate these ideas and to help students to seek out the ways that their courses converge and coalesce into a unique, individualized course of study.
