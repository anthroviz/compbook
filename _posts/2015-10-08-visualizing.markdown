# Design : Technology :: Art : Biology

at previous points in my Gallatin career I thought about Utopia, legacies

Stories we tell ourselves and each other - how do we reify our sentience and experience? Special focus on literal visual depictions, but all kinds of media will be considered. Dynamic systems over static (time series over cross sections/samples)

How to group data and ideas. Looking at the bigger picture. Especially social constructs and relationships

- families, sex partners, feminism, technology, avoiding the singularity
- origins (of humanity, language, art, culture, startups, computing)
- the structures that we put in place that enforce culture; addressing these (or being mindful) at the onset; integrating later
- optimism and progress theories
- biographies, autobiographies, biopics, memoirs, documentaries, paintings, photography, literature, poetry
- contemporary art, both in theory and practice
- markets, fundraising, social good, trying to leverage existing structures for different ends

What are the stories we tell about the future? What do we think about our origins? How do we learn?

Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny - Haeckel

Self-organization (biology) -> institutions

Weaving baskets of people and resources

Origins -> Legacies (cradle to cradle; cradle to grave - USING the human arc)

Layers, onions; recapitulation; fractals

Pattern matching and recognition and how this can be used incorrectly (when assumptions/conclusions are made)
