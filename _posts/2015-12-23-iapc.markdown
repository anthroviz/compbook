I took two years at Gallatin and two years off from Gallatin for personal reasons. During my sabbatical, I learned a lot about the didactic methods I require and was perhaps overlooking in my excitement of becoming "a college student." I also had time to self-reflect and learned a ton about myself. I have a stronger grasp of my values. I am excited to take these lessons back to formal education and Gallatin's community.

I chose Gallatin because I wanted more intellectual freedom than other schools that would have circumscribed me to the person I was when I was 18. I knew I had a lot of interests but I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I also knew I belonged in New York City. At the end of my college application process, I had acceptances from NYU and top art schools. I spent high school exploring different academic disciplines, as well as my natural interests and talents: painting, stagecraft, graphic design, literary magazines, music, typography, gaming, web design, entrepreneurship. I made the judgment call then that art school would be too limiting for someone like me, interested in a wide range of ideas as well as artmaking - I believe this is still the case and I am grateful that I chose Gallatin. I knew I wanted to be in the most dynamic city in the world. I believed I could make it work.

The other thing that motivated me was my huge ego.

I came into Gallatin after a huge trauma: my mother committed suicide when I was 16, during my Junior year of high school and in the middle of the college application process. At the time of her death we had been planning for me to attend traditional art school together, and I held close to that goal. I had also started a small business in high school doing web design with a friend, and she was proud of me for it.

My ego was a buffer against the harshness of my new world. My thinking back then was self-centered: that the Self is the most important determining factor, that we all have the will to power and this will overrides all. When I chose NYU, I thought I could remake myself in New York City and forget that I was hurt, scared, shattered by my mother's death, that I was a 17 year old girl recently bereaved.

I have since learned that this is ridiculous - the world is not a vacuum. Our universe is comprised of systems, in all scales. Our past does not dissipate based on our immediate experience or accomplishments. One person, at 17, at any age, cannot change the world; cannot do it all; cannot bring back her mom from the dead.

In that sense, I came in with grandiose thoughts about being a great artist or entrepreneur, but with a myopic focus on the end result rather than enjoying or even noticing the process. I hyped and believed my own hype. I explored contemporary art courses, social entrepreneurship courses, expecting that they would come in handy someday - when I was famous. I went through the motions with certain courses, choosing to use skills I already had instead of challenging myself to build new ones. I focused on the applied and the self-directed. I procrastinated and thought certain parts of the system were trivial bullshit, which I now recognize as important.

I was Icarus; I flew too close to the sun.

I thought then that having a fantastic life would offset the horrors that I had experienced. That somehow, since I had gone to the nadir, it would oscillate to a zenith. This is faulty thinking.
