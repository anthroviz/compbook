I took two years at Gallatin and two years off from Gallatin for personal reasons. During my sabbatical, I learned a lot about the didactic methods I require and was perhaps overlooking in my excitement of becoming "a college student." I also had time to self-reflect and have a stronger grasp of my values. I am excited to take these lessons back to formal education and Gallatin's community.

I chose Gallatin because I wanted more intellectual freedom than other schools that would have circumscribed me to the person I was when I was 18. I knew I had a lot of interests but I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I also knew I belonged in New York City. At the end of my college application process, I had acceptances from NYU and top art schools. I spent high school exploring different academic disciplines, as well as my natural interests and talents: painting, stagecraft, graphic design, literary magazines, music, typography, gaming, web design, entrepreneurship. I made the judgment call then that art school would be too limiting for someone like me, interested in a wide range of ideas as well as artmaking - I believe this is still the case and I am grateful that I chose Gallatin. I knew I wanted to be in the most dynamic city in the world. I believed I could make it work.

The other thing that motivated me was my huge ego.

I came into Gallatin after a huge trauma: my mother committed suicide when I was 16, during my Junior year of high school and in the middle of the college application process. At the time of her death we had been planning for me to attend traditional art school together, and I held close to that goal. I had also started a small business in high school doing web design with a friend, and she was proud of me for it.

My ego was a buffer against the harshness of my new world. My thinking back then was self-centered: that the Self is the most important determining factor, that we all have the will to power and this will overrides all. When I chose NYU, I thought I could remake myself in New York City and forget that I was hurt, scared, shattered by my mother's death, that I was a 17 year old girl recently bereaved.

I have since learned that this is ridiculous - the world is not a vacuum. Our universe is comprised of systems, in all scales. Our past does not dissipate based on our immediate experience or accomplishments. One person, at 17, at any age, cannot change the world; cannot do it all; cannot bring back her mom from the dead.

In that sense, I came in with grandiose thoughts about being a great artist or entrepreneur, but with a myopic focus on the end result rather than enjoying or even noticing the process. I hyped and believed my own hype. I explored contemporary art courses, social entrepreneurship courses, expecting that they would come in handy someday - when I was famous. I went through the motions with certain courses, choosing to use skills I already had instead of challenging myself to build new ones. I focused on the applied and the self-directed. I procrastinated and thought certain parts of the system were trivial bullshit, which I now recognize as important.

I was Icarus; I flew too close to the sun.

I thought then that having a fantastic life would offset the horrors that I had experienced. That somehow, since I had gone to the nadir, it would oscillate to a zenith. This is faulty thinking.

I have reversed my priorities. The secret is, it has always been about the process rather than the end result.

I have processed a lot of trauma and bad decisions.

I have learned a lot about myself in the past two years.  I was living my life without really looking or noticing where I was going. Now I spend my time in the moment, seeing what is in order to think about how things can be. In a way this is an extension of my education before Gallatin. I spent my childhood and adolesence in weekly art lessons, learning to see what exists in real space, and then using that to create anew. Drawing practice has been integral to my life in remembering and synthesizing ideas. The process of making is important to me, as is having the end result as a reminder.

I realize I wanted the ideas to live through expression, but as I've learned, the individual narrative is only exciting if it's relational. I want to create participatory visual experiences for others to understand their potential. I will do so through exploring mostly visual modalities: drawing, coding, writing.

Telling stories honestly and helping others to do the same. I like to know how to do things and knowing alternatives and processes for future use. Systems provide flexibility; there is no one way of being. I did not understand this coming into school. I like learning new ideas and integrating them through practice. I like to learn about new ways of doing things because it helps me plan alternatives. 

I have become someone who makes things happen instead of stewing. I want to use that newfound power and the privilege I have for good, to help people up.

My perspective differs from many because I understand the world is not limitless, yet I retain optimism that we can improve. My talents are in unpacking systems and making new ones to be better. 

My concentration will be entitled Visualizing Human Narratives. I will be looking at data and storytelling through the lenses and disciplines of art, design, technology, and biology. How do we make sense of the world? What are the stories we tell ourselves?

Visual representation is a powerful and immediate way to communicate - it marks the advent of humanity. Code and design are ways to amplify the messages of art through democratization. Analogies and systems.

Information is power. There are so many ways of expression and representation that our usual approaches flatten.

Biology because organic structures and the way they self-organize and maintain homeostasis. I am inspired by symbiosis and other win-win situations. Being in industry has taught me that it actually isn't a zero sum game. I am interested in analyzing humanity's origins (which many would argue is precipitated by tools and art) and directing where we can go in the future. Stories data to bear it out. Bringing the magic of fiction into everyday life... humanizing... Tech and Design are humanmade ways to channel art and science

As we become bigger and bigger we need to remember that data points are individual human stories. Dynamic systems instead of static points. I've always believed and Gallatin has reinforced that connection between people and ideas are what matters. Storytelling and bigger picture thinking through data visualization.

I hope to shift people's thinking to be more systematic, long range, and interdisciplinary. Diverse and inclusive.



I want to combine my skills in building and making, my talent of seeing the bigger picture, and love of helping others.

Although satisified with what I have, I always am thinking of ways to make it better. A lot of empowerment is knowing you can figure things out. I hope that the systems I will learn to build can inspire others.




// of the moment, ideas are not always presented in the right ways.

making applied work outside of school

showing and collaborating with the entire gallatin ecosystem

helping grow and amplify each other

data point to make humanity's story more clear

fine lines between things. things are not that easy. things do not happen in a vaccuum.
