Literally diffing self-representation from

- 2011 entering Gallatin (Denial)
- 2012 (Anger)
- 2013 leaving Gallatin (Bargaining)
- 2014 (Depression)
- 2015 reentering Gallatin (Acceptance)

Kübler-Ross model as a nice guide but it's waves instead of linear

Make this a real time series too, that'd be fun

Mermaid and Scorpion vs. Wang Tiles

Evolving and streamlining my identity. Becoming more generative, less personally-focused

Life events that helped me figure this out

The place of drawing practice

### Dinner Party edit 1

cheryl wu | host, new york city | Cheryl lost her mother to suicide when she was 16, in 2010. She chose to attend NYU over art school at the last minute as she always knew she belonged here. After some New York hijinks, Cheryl got herself a fulltime Big Girl Job as a Product Designer for Nasdaq. 

She loves fostering inclusive communities and connecting worthy people, especially in the tech industry. Others have used the following analogies to describe her: a radar, an interpersonal basket-weaver, a Swiss Army Knife, and a simulated stimulant.

Cheryl became a Dinner Party host in 2015 because she was adrift with her stigmatized loss and wanted to help others in the same boat. The loss felt more acute being amongst young and optimistic peers with supportive parents. 

When not at work, organizing parties, or pursuing her undergraduate in Visualizing Human Narratives at NYU Gallatin, she loves the arts.  You'll likely find her visiting museums and galleries, reading, writing, drawing, or exploring the city's parks. She's recently taken up cycling around Manhattan like a maniac.

Cheryl lives on the Upper East Side near Central Park. She shares her studio with houseplants Stanley, Star Child, Smiangle, and Severus; several adorable (fake) bees; and inflatable dinosaur Stromae.
